All the codes for individual sensor interfacing were written separately to avoid extraneous debugging.
The sensor value codes were integrated into a single code block, and the processing code was developed with dummy sensor variables.

Actual conditions of mine were simulated by testing entire system both outside and inside a room, to mirror `GPS-denied` conditions.
